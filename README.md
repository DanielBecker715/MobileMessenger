A fully encrypted open source Messenger for `Android`

My messenger is simple and strongly encrypted with AES. The encrypted data is then delivered to the recipient via a server. The server can never see your data because it is encrypted. Only the sender and receiver have the possibility to decrypt the message.

## Getting Started

This messenger is currently under development and not yet available. Stay tuned for updates on my progress!
